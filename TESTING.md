# Testing

## Frontend and desktop shell

```bash
corepack pnpm@10.30.3 -C apps install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm@10.30.3 -C apps run build:desktop
corepack pnpm@10.30.3 -C apps run test:runtime
corepack pnpm@10.30.3 -C apps run test:e2e
```

`test:runtime` validates the maintained browser/desktop transport surface, command registration, and key utility behavior. `test:e2e` builds the static export and exercises the three supported routes with mocked service responses. Install Playwright browsers when prompted by Playwright.

## Rust

```bash
cargo test --workspace --locked -- --test-threads=1
cargo test -p codexmanager-service --locked labcontext::tests
cargo test -p codexmanager-web --locked
cargo test --manifest-path apps/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --locked --lib
```

For gateway or protocol changes, add targeted coverage for responses and chat-completions endpoints, streaming and non-streaming flows, and tool calls.

The workspace command intentionally uses one test thread: part of the service suite switches
between isolated SQLite files through process-wide environment variables. This keeps the
documented command and CI deterministic.

The desktop updater is intentionally disabled until `CODEXMANAGER_UPDATE_REPO=owner/repository` is configured. Keep it unset in development and public-source checks unless you are testing your own GitHub Release feed.

## Container and release checks

```bash
scripts/open-source/preflight.sh
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.self-hosted.yml config
scripts/open-source/package.sh CodexManager-open-source
```

Compose 配置和启动需要 `CODEXMANAGER_WEB_ACCESS_PASSWORD_FILE_HOST` 指向私有密码文件；按 [服务器部署说明](docs/open-source/01-server-deployment.md) 创建它。预检在 Docker 可用时会使用临时空文件仅验证 Compose 语法，不能替代真实 secret 的启动测试。

The preflight script intentionally fails when it finds runtime secrets, user-specific plugin registrations, personal deployment references, or known personal/promotional assets.
